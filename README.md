[![Build Status][travis-img]][travis]
[![Coverage Status][coverage-img]][coverage]

## Features

Combined with [Vault][], [Warden][] and [Propsd][], Tokend gives security and accountability around the delivery of secrets to servers running in the cloud.

Tokend provides a seamless interface between [Vault][] and [Propsd][] allowing developers to specify the secrets they need for their service without putting unencrypted secrets out in the wild.

## Usage

See the [getting started guide][gsg] for help installing, configuring, and using Tokend.

## Development

See the **Development** section of the [getting started guide][gsg-d] for more information.

## Releasing

To cut a release do the following:

* [Bump the version][npm-version]
* Build and upload a package
* Create a new release on github.com

This can be accomplished by running the following commands:

```bash
$ npm version minor
$ bundle exec rake default
```

To be able to create a new release on github.com, you must have the following environment variables set:
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_TOKEN`

and the user and token must have the appropriate permissions in this repository.
